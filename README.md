## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start run the prebuild script, and start the dev server:

```bash
npm run prebuild

npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
